May need to create a new REPO for this project and keep the other one as a basic battlescene MVP, and use this one
for the custom MVP stuff you'll do with action battle points, etc.

That would probably be easiest, since the changes you've done have messed with the .xml files and made the unversioned
file get furious any time you try to do anything.

Compiler.xml seems pretty important, too. But oh well...
